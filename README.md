## Assignment: Building your Profile Page with React Native Core Components

For this assignment, I created a simple profile page using Expo + React Native. I decided to make two seperate components, the profile page and the input form for comments. Pretty straight forward assignment and I didn't have many issues setting it up. The only big issue I had was dealing with the ScrollView styling. The scroll view wasn't allowing me to view content past the bottom border of it so I had to implement styling for `contentContainerStyle`.
